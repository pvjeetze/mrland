#' @title calcConservationPriorities
#' @description Function calculates land area in conservation priority areas that was unprotected in 2020 (WDPA).
#'
#' @param consvBaseYear Reference year for land conservation. Chosing "y1750", for instance, means that
#' the reference land use is based on the year 1750 ('pre-industrial') so
#' land use can be restored to the pre-industrial state in conservation priority areas.
#' Any year available in the LUH3 data set can be chosen. Historic land use in the LUH3 data
#' is based on the HYDE data base.
#' The choice "y2020" provides a special case, in which reference land use is based on the 2020 ESA CCI LULC map,
#' derived at a spatial resolution of 300 x 300 Meter.
#' @param cells (deprecated) number of cells of landmask (only "lpjcell" for 67420 cells)
#' @param nclasses Options are either "seven" or "nine".
#' \itemize{
#' \item "seven" separates primary and secondary forest and includes "crop", "past", "forestry",
#' "primforest", "secdforest", "urban" and "other"
#' \item "nine" adds the separation of pasture and rangelands, as well as a differentiation of
#' primary and secondary non-forest vegetation and therefore returns "crop", "past", "range",
#' "forestry", "primforest", "secdforest", "urban", "primother" and "secdother"
#' }
#' @param baseYearIPLCLand Whether the reference year for land conservation \code{"consvBaseYear"}
#' also is applied to IPLC land. The default is \code{FALSE} to avoid land-use change on IPLC land.
#'
#' @return magpie object in cellular resolution with different protection options in conservation priority areas
