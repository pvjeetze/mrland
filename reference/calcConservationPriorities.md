# calcConservationPriorities

Function calculates land area in conservation priority areas that was
unprotected in 2020 (WDPA).

## Usage

``` r
calcConservationPriorities(
  consvBaseYear = "y1750",
  cells = "lpjcell",
  nclasses = "seven",
  baseYearIPLCLand = FALSE
)
```

## Arguments

- consvBaseYear:

  Reference year for land conservation. Chosing "y1750", for instance,
  means that the reference land use is based on the year 1750
  ('pre-industrial') so land use can be restored to the pre-industrial
  state in conservation priority areas. Any year available in the LUH3
  data set can be chosen. Historic land use in the LUH3 data is based on
  the HYDE data base. The choice "y2020" provides a special case, in
  which reference land use is based on the 2020 ESA CCI LULC map,
  derived at a spatial resolution of 300 x 300 Meter.

- cells:

  (deprecated) number of cells of landmask (only "lpjcell" for 67420
  cells)

- nclasses:

  Options are either "seven" or "nine".

  - "seven" separates primary and secondary forest and includes "crop",
    "past", "forestry", "primforest", "secdforest", "urban" and "other"

  - "nine" adds the separation of pasture and rangelands, as well as a
    differentiation of primary and secondary non-forest vegetation and
    therefore returns "crop", "past", "range", "forestry", "primforest",
    "secdforest", "urban", "primother" and "secdother"

- baseYearIPLCLand:

  Whether the reference year for land conservation `"consvBaseYear"`
  also also is applied to IPLC land. The default is `FALSE` to avoid
  land-use change on IPLC land.

in conservation priority areas
