# calcYieldsCalibrated

This functions calibrates extracted yields from LPJmL to FAO country
level yields

## Usage

``` r
calcYieldsCalibrated(
  source = c(lpjml = "ggcmi_phase3_nchecks_9ca735cb", isimip = NULL),
  climatetype = "GSWP3-W5E5:historical",
  refYear = "y1995",
  selectyears = seq(1965, 2100, by = 5),
  cells = "lpjcell",
  multicropping = FALSE,
  refYields = FALSE,
  areaSource = "FAO",
  marginal_land = "magpie"
)
```

## Arguments

- source:

  Defines LPJmL version for main crop inputs and isimip replacement. For
  isimip choose crop model/gcm/rcp/co2 combination formatted like this:
  "yields:EPIC-IIASA:ukesm1-0-ll:ssp585:default:3b"

- climatetype:

  switch between different climate scenarios

- refYear:

  reference year for calibration

- selectyears:

  Years to be returned (for memory reasons)

- cells:

  number of cells "magpiecell" for 59199 cells or "lpjcell" for 67420
  cells

- multicropping:

  Multicropping activated (TRUE) or not (FALSE) and Multiple Cropping
  Suitability mask selected (mask can be: "none": no mask applied (only
  for development purposes) "actual:total": currently multicropped areas
  calculated from total harvested areas and total physical areas per
  cell from readLanduseLandInG "actual:crop" (crop-specific),
  "actual:irrigation" (irrigation-specific), "actual:irrig_crop" (crop-
  and irrigation-specific), "potential:endogenous": potentially
  multicropped areas given temperature and productivity limits
  "potential:exogenous": potentially multicropped areas given GAEZ
  suitability classification) (e.g. TRUE:actual:total; TRUE:none; FALSE)

- refYields:

  assumption for baseline yields with respect to multiple cropping
  (e.g., FALSE: single-cropped LPJmL yields used as baseline to
  calculate country-level yields, "TRUE:actual:irrig_crop": multicropped
  yields where LandInG reports current multiple cropping (irrigation-
  and crop-specific))

- areaSource:

  data source for croparea used in calculation: FAO or LandInG Note:
  when calibrating multicropped yields, LandInG croparea should be used

- marginal_land:

  Defines which share of marginal land should be included (see options
  below) and whether suitable land under irrigated conditions
  ("irrigated"), under rainfed conditions ("rainfed") or suitability
  under rainfed conditions including currently irrigated land
  (rainfed_and_irrigated) should be used. Options combined via ":" The
  different marginal land options are:

  - `"all_marginal"`: All marginal land (suitability index between
    0-0.33) is included as suitable

  - `"q33_marginal"`: The bottom tertile (suitability index below 0.13)
    of the marginal land area is excluded.

  - `"q50_marginal"`: The bottom half (suitability index below 0.18) of
    the marginal land area is excluded.

  - `"q66_marginal"`: The first and second tertile (suitability index
    below 0.23) of the marginal land area are excluded.

  - `"q75_marginal"`: The first, second and third quartiles (suitability
    index below 0.25) of the marginal land are are excluded

  - `"no_marginal"`: Areas with a suitability index of 0.33 and lower
    are excluded.

  - `"magpie"`: Returns "all_marginal:rainfed_and_irrigated",
    "q33_marginal:rainfed_and_irrigated" and
    "no_marginal:rainfed_and_irrigated" in a magclass object to be used
    as magpie input.

## Value

magpie object in cellular resolution from reference year onwards
